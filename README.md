Hello-OBP-OAuth1.0a-Node
========================

This is a very basic app to demonstrate the integration of the OpenBankProject with OAuth1.0-Authentication
into a NodeJS application.

## SETUP

Get consumer key / secret:
register your client at https://apisandbox.openbankproject.com/consumer-registration
and add the host, key and secret in your config.json file like so:


	config.json
	
    {
    "apiHost": "https://apisandbox.openbankproject.com PLEASE CHANGE THIS TO THE HOST YOU ARE USING!!", 
    "consumerKey": "YOUR CONSUMER KEY GOES HERE",
    "consumerSecret" : "YOUR CONSUMER SECRET GOES HERE",
    "redirectUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:8085/callback"
    }




Install Dependencies:
npm install

Start Server:
node oauth.js

Navigate to the page:
http://127.0.0.1:8085
(not http://localhost:8085 in this example as the session won't be set)

You can log in as a test user, using the following credentials on the general OBP API sandbox:

username: joe.bloggs@example.com
password: qwerty

Each public sandbox generally has a github wiki page with dummy customer logins. See the home page of the API sandbox you are using.
